	<h1>My First React App - Mario's Pizzerria</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my Pizza Website, a React app that I created to showcase my skills in front-end development. The website features a menu, about, homepage, and contact pages, all beautifully designed with CSS. The app was originally hosted on Heroku, but since that platform is no longer free, it cannot be accessed anymore. However, you yet can run the app locally.</p>
	<h2>How to Run the App</h2>
	<p>To run the app locally, follow these steps:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Download the app's repository to your local machine.</li>
	  <li>Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.</li>
	  <li>Run the command <code>npm install</code> to install the necessary dependencies.</li>
	  <li>Run the command <code>npm start</code> to start the development server.</li>
	  <li>The website should open automatically in your browser at <code>localhost:3000</code>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>By following these simple steps, you'll be able to run the app locally on your machine.</p>
